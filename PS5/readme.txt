(1) How the code base is organized

We have the folder source_code in which we have :

+ classification: In this folder we have all the code for machine learning algorithms, each file for 1 machine learing
algorithms. The main file is main_classification.py

+ csv: In this folder, we have all the data set in form of .csv files for each phase of our project

+ features_selection: In this folder, we have all the code for feature selections process, each file for 1 feature selection
technique. The main file is main_features_selection.py

+ image: In this folder, we conserve all the image and plot which are generated during the executing of program

* run_program.sh : This file is to run our program


(2) The commands to run your code

+ To execute the program simply run the following commands:

# chmod +x run_program.sh
# ./run_program.sh


+ If pydotplus module is not installed in your system yet, please install it:
